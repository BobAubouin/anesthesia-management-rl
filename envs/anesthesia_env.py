    Building a configurable model for patient response and drug dynamics during anesthesia

    Attributes:
        config (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration dictionary containing all the needed parameters for setting
        up the patient model and initial state. Expected keys include:
        - 'patient_age'
        - 'patient_weight'
        - 'surgery_type'
        - 'surgery_duration'

        - Additional keys can be added as needed

    Methods:
        _setup_patient_model: Initializes the PKPD model based on the configuration
        _initialize_patient_state: Sets the initial state of the patient based on the configuration
