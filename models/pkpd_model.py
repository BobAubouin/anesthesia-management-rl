    A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for propofol
    Considering factors that can add to the anesthetic effects

    Attributes:
    ec50 (float): The concentration of propofol at which 50% of the maximum effect is achieved. This helps
    determine the potency of the drug at different concentrations.
    gamma (float): The rate at which the effect of propofol increases with increasing concentration 
    (the steepness of the drug response curve)
    ke0 (float): The rate constant for drug equilibration between the plasma and the effect site.
    This impacts the speed at which the drug reaches its maximum effect. ie the patient reaches the desired depth of anesthesia
